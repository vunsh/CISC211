## 2. Challenges Encountered (1 mark)

Some challenges I faced during the lab:

- I always forget that the ASCII for each binary digit begins with 128, for some reason I mix it up with 256.
- Remembering to add a 0 at the beginning of the binary created from dividing the ASCII values by 2.

## Strategy for Mismatched Lengths

If the key is shorter than the plaintext, I would use a key reptition. For example if my message was "CODED", I would use the key "KEYSKE" to match the length of the plaintext.
