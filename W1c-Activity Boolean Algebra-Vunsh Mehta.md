## 2. Challenges

Something I encoutered when simplifying (especially the first problem) was knowing when to apply identities for things like XOR operations. 

## 3. Boolean Simplification (Problem 1)

**Given:**

```
F = A'B'C' + A'B'C + A'BC + AB'C + ABC'
```

### Final Simplified Expression:

```
F = A'B' + C(A âŠ• B) + ABC'
```

## 4. Logic Expression (Problem 2)

**Scenario:**

- `m` = motion detected  
- `t` = test mode  
- `i` = light turns on

**Final Answer:**

```
i = mt' + t
```
